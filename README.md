Heart Diseases Prediction using Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression Algorithm is used to solve the classification type of problem (i.e the output variable has a classes amoung them).In Heart Diseases prediction model we have to predict the heart disease is occured or not based on provided dataset(eg.age,blood pressure,cholestrol level and maximun heart rate etc.)

### Dataset
Follow independent columns are used to build the model 'age', 'sex', 'cp', 'trtbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 'thalachh',
       'exng', 'oldpeak', 'slp', 'caa', 'thall';'output' column has a two categories '0' and '1' which we want to predict

for the evaluation purpose confusion matrix is plotted and accuracy score ,precision and auroc score parameter where used
